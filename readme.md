### Description
the non-linear convection term is explicitly estimated. THe velocity (U) and mass-flux (phi) are filtered using a LES type filter specified in the __regularization__ sub-dictionary in the system/fvSolution case file. In this class, the regularization is 4th order accurate; implemented as:

    Uf = filter(U);     UPrime = (U - Uf)
    phif       = filter(phi); phiPrime = (phi - phif)
    C(phi, U)  = fvc::div(phi, U)
    C2(phi, U) = filter(C(phif, Uf))
    C4(phi, U) = C(phif, Uf) + filter(C(phif, UPrime)) + filter(C(phiPrime, Uf))
    C6(phi, U) = C(phif, Uf) + C(phif, UPrime))+ C(phiPrime, Uf) + filter(C(phiPrime, UPrime))

    A6(phi, U) =  C(phi, U) - residual(C(phiPrime, UPrime))

Sample regularization dictionary in fvSolution file:

    regularization
    {
        // Verstappen regularization
        regOrder  C6; // C4; // C2;
        filter    polyLaplace;

        // A6: compact formulation of C6
        regOrder  A6;
        filter    polyLaplaceResidual;

        // epsilon 2
        d1        0.16666667;
        d2        0.00416667;

        // epsilon 3
        d1        0.375;
        d2        0.0375;
    }
