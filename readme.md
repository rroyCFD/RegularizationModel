### Description
The non-linear convection term is explicitly estimated. THe velocity (U) and mass-flux (phi) are filtered using a LES type filter specified in the __regularization__ sub-dictionary in the system/fvSolution case file. In this class, the regularization is 4th order accurate; implemented as:

    Uf = filter(U);     UPrime = (U - Uf)
    phif = filter(phi); phiPrime = (phi - phif)
    C(phi, U) = fvc::div(phi, U)
    C4(phi, U) = C(phif, Uf) + filter(C(phif, UPrime)) + filter(C(phiPrime, Uf))

Sample filter description:

    regularization
    {
        filter    simple;
    }


    regularization
    {
        filter    polyLaplace;
        d1        0.16666667;
        d2        0.00416667;
    }

Filters of the 2nd and 6th order would be added in the future release, if needed. More about the regularization filters are available in
